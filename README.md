# team-treehouse-javascript-techdegree
For my Team Treehouse Javascript Techdegree

/* This is an integration of my fledgling Github ID into my Team Treehouse Full-stack Javascipt Techdegree. I'm adding a whole bunch of elementary noise to the fray, because it's a great way to learn and progress and document my #evolution. Until I'm further in my studies, my repositories will be of, guaranteed, little import, but it's my public space to learn and master the basics, and get help, and learn from others, and build a great practice full of fun, playfyul coding. Bonjour, monde.
